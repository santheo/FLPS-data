   <p>At about two o'clock yesterday afternoon, members of various Polish national societies began to gather at Pulaski Hall, 4831-33 South Throop Street. Before three o'clock, they had formed into ranks at the head of which marched Miss L. Kunecki, leading a large group of little "Faleon" girls, future members of nest 133. The children of members, and members of Nest 105, Polish Falcons Alliance, led by F. Gierlowski followed, marching to the rhythmic beat of drums. Behind them marched the societies "God Save Poland" (Group 1955, Polish National Alliance), "Victery at Grunwald" (Group 1192, Polish National Alliance), and the K. Brodzinski Dramatic Circle. Other societies did not take part because of annual meetings that were being held at this time, or for other reasons unknown to us.</p>
   <p>The parade proceeded to the large Sherman Park Hall, where the exercises were opened with a short speech by Ludwig Nowakowski before a large <pb facs="5423968_11_0516.jpg" n="2"/>audience. He named S. Stachowski as chairman, and W. Filipiak as secretary. He also invited the presidents of local societies, Casimir Zychlinski, president of the Polish National Alliance, and W. Wrzesinaski, a director of the Polish National Alliance, to take their places on the platform. The program, which followed immediately, consisted of orchestral music, vocal solos, choral numbers, recitations, and an address by Mr. Zychlinski. For the first number, the Polish orchestra, conducted by J. Zielonka, played a march, after which the well-known Vistula Chorus sang "November Medley," under the direction of Z. Filisiewicz. The next number deserves special mention because after reciting "The Complaint of Polish Children," little Alfreda Czajkowski asked the public to contribute to the Christmas fund for the poor children of Poland who are dying of hunger and cold. The child then passed through the audience and collected a total of $24.02.</p>
   <p>A vocal solo, "Polonaise," by Mrs. Helen Szelewicz followed. By popular request, she returned to the platform to sing "Krakowiak". The little <pb facs="5423968_11_0517.jpg" n="3"/>Falcon girls of Nest 133, Polish Falcons Alliance, Group 1141, Polish National Alliance, then sang "White Eagle", directed by Miss L. Kunecki. Little Miss Harriet Furmaniak received so much applause for her piano solo that she was forced to give an encore, after which the singing and dramatic society Druzyna sang "Medley of [Polish] National Hymns" [by Jan Gall], under the direction of J. Jakaitis. T. Paszynski's recitation of "The Death of a Traitor to his Country," and a choral number by the Lira Chorus, directed by Mr. Jakaitis, followed. Mr. C. Zychlinski, president of the Polish National Alliance, then delivered his eloquent address. He spoke for more than an hour, outlining the history of the [three] Polish partitions, and the outbreak and failure of the insurrections. After covering the entire post-partition history of Poland, up until the present time, the speaker passed to the present political situation in Poland. He spoke of the new blows from which Poland is constantly suffering, the heaviest of which was the recent death of that great philanthropist and leader of the Polish nation, Henryk Sienkiewicz, who carried enlightenment to the poorest homes, and devoted his life to Poland. "For this reason too," said the speaker, "we ought to follow his example by collecting money for <pb facs="5423968_11_0518.jpg" n="4"/>that nation which is now suffering so terribly, and which is forced to give its blood not in its own cause, but in the cause of its conquerors." The speaker then explained the political tactics of our three oppressors, and how their promises that Poland will be given autonomy, or that the province of Warsaw will become a so-called buffer-state, [are meaningless]. Mr. Zychlinski concluded his address with a plea for contributions to the relief fund and a demand for an independent Poland--independent in the full sense of the word, with boundaries such as existed before the first partition. His speech was received with enthusiasm and the hall shook with applause for a few minutes after its conclusion. The orchestra conducted by Z. Zielonka played "Mazeppa" while a collection for the relief fund was taken up. The collection netted $16.95.</p>
   <p>The young Falcons of Nest 105 then sang "Though the Storm Howls," directed by their leader, F. Gierlowski, after which little Miss C. Furmaniak recited a very touching poem, "A Sorrowful Anniversary".</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_11_0519.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>After a final number by the orchestra, the chairman thanked all those who had contributed to the success of the exercises. The exercises were then closed with "Boze Cos Polske" [God Save Poland], sung by the audience.</p>
   <p>It should be added that all of the numbers on the program were eminently successful and that the audience was generous with its applause. The two collections totaled $40.97.</p>
