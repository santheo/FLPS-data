   <p>Today is the third anniversary of the Daily Jewish Forward in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Forward has always had a large circle of readers and friends in Chicago. When it was decided to establish the Forward in Chicago, the Jewish public accepted the new venture with great pleasure and pride, and wished the new publication continued success.</p>
   <p>In the beginning, it was a rather difficult task to establish the Forward firmly.</p>
   
   <p>But we can now tell all our friends and comrades, with assurance and pride, that our hardships are a thing of the past.</p>
   <p>The Forward has been constantly growing during the past three years, and is now fully grown. From a business standpoint, considering the number of readers and the influence of the Forward, we can say that our publication is soundly established. Not only in moral strength, but in financial standing as well.</p>
   <p>Three years is not such a long time. But when we look around and see what the Daily Forward has done in that time, we cannot help but admit that we are proud of our accomplishments.</p>
   
   <p>Chicago has the second largest Jewish population of any city in America, and of any city in the world. For a long time, it bore the reputation of a city where vice flourished. But a radical change for the better has taken place since the advent of the Forward. With the help of pious Jews,the Forward fought against vice in the Jewish community.</p>
   <p>The Forward has served the public in a useful manner, by publishing latest news, interesting and educational articles, and literature written by some of the greatest Jewish writers.</p>
   <p>From its inception, the Forward has been, (and still is) constantly working in the interests of the Jewish working-class in Chicago. It is the organ of the labor movement of the Socialist Party, the unions, and the Workmen's Circle. Therefore, it is natural for it to devote its efforts, its entire power, to the [labor] movement in the great struggle between capital and labor - the struggle between those who do nothing and have everything, and those who do all the work and have nothing.</p>
   <p>In this great struggle, the aim of the Forward is to help abolish the present fetid social system that spells poverty, disease, misery, war, etc. At this moment, while these lines are about to go to press, the cloak-makers of Chicago are rejoicing over the results of their first victory.</p>
   <p>When we first intended to expand, we pointed out that the New York Forward had many readers long before the Chicago Forward was established. The latter is now a branch of the New York Forward.</p>
   
   <p>The 25th anniversary of the New York Forward will be celebrated on the same date. A quarter of a century has shown the accomplishment of a few hundred Jews who contributed from their meagre earnings in order to organize a newspaper, that would not belong to any private individual and would not constitute a business for private profiteering.</p>
   <p>The Forward is intended to be the exclusive organ of the working-class, a powerful weapon in the struggle for everything that is right and just. In the course of twenty-five years, the Forward has grown to be the largest, the best, and the most influential Jewish newspaper in the world.</p>
   <p>At the end of this quarter century the Forward has also found a field in Chicago, a field so large and powerful that the success is much greater than expected. Today marks the New Year! The birthday of the Forward coincides with the first day of our New Year. When this issue is being taken off the press, horns will sound, bells will ring, and people, with mixed feelings of joy and regret, will bid farewell to the old year. A new year is being born, and with the new year, new hopes, new dreams, and new desires are also being born.</p>
   <p>We wish you success during the new year. We wish the workers luck and success in all their movements and struggle and we hope that the new year will bring the Forward more useful work and still better results than it has had up to now.</p>
