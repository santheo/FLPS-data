      <p>The Rev. Krawczunas selected a committee of old women and of the so-called 
male singers who examined the parish books. As a matter cf course,
the committee vindicated the priest, printed its report and distributed
it among the people.</p>
      <p>We are publishing the report in full text.</p>
      <p>"The committee's report of the examination of the books of St. George's
Parish, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
      <p>We, the undersigned committee, have been elected by the public at a
parish meeting, at the church of St. George, Bridgeport, Chicago, Illinois,
the 7th day of August, this year, to examine the parish books and the budget
from the date of establishment of this church to the present time. We are
assuring our parishioners that the parish books and the budget were kept in
the best order by Rev. Krawczunas, and only by the efforts and elevation of
the priest was it possible to keep the books in such good order.</p>
      <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
      <p>"The income and expenses of every year were stated plainly in separate
items, and the balance of each year stated how much money was left,

how much money was short.</p>
      <p>"Only in the year 1896 was it stated by mistake that there were $350.88

short, and on account of this minor mistake it looked as if in that year no

money was left in the budget. But after correction of that mistake, we find

$223.50 in the budget, and the shortage was only $127.32</p>
      <p>"We found that the Polish nuns were brought to the church by the

rector, and that for the last four months of 1897, the wages to the nuns

were paid by Rev. Krawczunas out of his own pocket.</p>

      <p>What do you brothers think after you have read this report? What

do you say for such soaping of your eyes? The question is for what does 

the Rev. Krawczunas with his selected committee hold his parishioners?

Fools? Does it look to them as if there is no one in the parish who

knows how to read. In this so-called committee report is not one word

of truth, it is a lie from the beginning to the end.</p>
      <p>The committee in its report assures the parishioners that they examined 
the books from the inception of the parish up to the present time,

and that they found the Rev. Krawczunas' statements were made with accuracy

and efficiency; that the yearly general income and expenses show clearly

how much surplus and how much shortage of the money there was, and that

after the accounting, the committee found, up to every cent, that the

Rev. Krawczunas’ report was done in good faith.</p>
      <p>If the priest's committee had found a correct statement of income

and expenses and while the committee showed to the parishioners only the

expenses, why then did the committee conceal the income. Were their brains

unable to find them or did the priest asked them to conceal it? The committee
<a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>

boasted that all the income and expenses were correctly found, but in its 

own report stated that the Rev. Krawczunas expenses were $41,758.50, and

for the benefit to the parish, the priest assumed the debt of $19,077.48.

Is this the account of Rev. Krawczunas' management of the parish during

the past five years? Where is the income? Did the parishioners give nothing

during those past years? Did Rev. Krawczunas pay from his own pocket? Where

is the truth?</p>
      <p>The committee in its report states that $11,200 were paid for the lots.

We are asking the committee, who paid that $11,200 for those lots? Did Rev.

Krawczunas pay for them? When our Rev. Krawczunas was living in the old

country, the lots at that time were almost paid for. When Rev. Krawczunas

came to Chicago, he found that on the parish lots there was only $600 of

debt. But, when Rev. Krawczunas bought two more lots for $3,600 the priest

paid only $4,200. but not $11,200, which his committee showed to us and

wants us to believe. Where is the truth? Maybe the committee, by way of

vindicating itself, will say that this report is not only that of Rev.

Krawczunas, but the report of Rev. Kolesinskis shows the same. The committee 
willingly showed the expenses of both priests, but made no effort

<a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>

to show the income of Rev. Krawczunas, nor of Rev. Kolesinskis.</p>
      <p>Why is the committee trying to blind the contributing parishioners?

Why are you holding the people up as laughing stock? Where is the money

that the Rev. Krawczunas himself stated in both of his statements? Did

the money sink into the pocket of Rev. Krawczunas, or was the money spent

for the reception of the Polish guests, or was the money lost in some other

place?</p>
      <p>Let us take once more a glimpse into the statement of Rev. Krawczunas

himself, as given to the parish:

</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Where is the balance of $36,981.28? And yet the priest went into debt,

$19,077.48 without the parish knowledge!</p>
      <p>Where has the balance of $36,981.28 vanished? Did the priest swallow it?</p>
      <p>Let us divide the balance of $36,981.23 for the last three years of

Rev. Krawczunas' income. It would be over $34 per day. Besides this profit

mentioned, the priest had his income from mass, baptism, nuptial ceremonies

and funerals; also the priest was traveling in other small towns where the

Lithuanians are living, collected money from them, and yet even this profit

was not enough. For this reason our priest was forced to take $34 per day

from the parish treasury for his own personal needs, while at the same time

the priest agreed to fulfill all the parish duties for the salary of $70 per

<a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>

month. Really, our little priest is very gluttonous. If in Chicago we would

have five such gluttonous men, they would eat up all our wages, we could

not even be able to make enough for them, and we ourselves would be forced

to live without any eating.</p>
      <p>We are standing on the facts given by the priest himself in the year

1896. Where is the account of 1897 and 1898? Did the parishioners give

nothing for the parish during the last two years, because the priest shows

no income? Did the priest obtain an order from God to go to Lithuanian

homes twice a year and extort money from every one as much as he could

and to keep for himself the extorted money? When anybody asks the priest

to give account of the money he denounces him as infidel, but when you

are keeping quiet then everything is all right. What name, then, can we

give to the priest's committee and the priest himself?</p>
      <p>

The committee in its report says: "Rev. Krawczunas kept the account

of the parish with great care. Of course, if Rev. Krawczunas was able to

eat up $34 per day, including all other profits, that shows how much

"effort" he had put to it. We see his "effort," that without such "effort,"

<a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>

he could not have been able to consume so much money per day.</p>
      <p>
The committee was trying to prove that the priest had brought the

nuns himself, and that during the four months' time the priest fed and paid

them wages from his own pocket. We are asking the committee, who demanded

those nuns? The parish? The priest demanded them because he was uneasy

without the nuns. If the nuns are serving the priest, wash his laundry,

then let the priest pay them. but not the parish. If the nuns are serving

the priest in the same way as his girl servant, is it necessary then, for

the parish to pay the wages for the priest's servants?</p>
      <p>
The selected committee boasted in its report that the committee for

inspection of the parish books was elected at the public meeting at St.

George's church. This is falsehood: About this parish meeting the public

knew nothing; the meeting was called by Rev. Krawczunas himself, not by

the church. When almost all the people left the church, and while in the

church remained only a few old women and a few of the so-called singers.
<a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>

the priest held the meeting with those ignoramuses in the name of the

parish. And then they elected such a committee, who wrote the report, not

according to the statement in the book, but according to the priest's

order, in order to deceive the parishioners. During the last three years

Rev. Krawczunas held no parish meeting; the priest feels that the public

meeting will be dangerous for him; he is as afraid of one as the Jew of

holy water, and the priest is trying his best to cast dust into the

parishioners' eyes.</p>
      <p>

If this meeting had been held with the parish’s consent, the societies

would make no protest. Today, the societies of the Province of God, Saint

John the Baptist and Saint George, protested, and we believe other societies

will make protest and will seek justice. The parish ought to get rid of

such treasurers who are eating as much as $34 per day. If, for the last

three years, the debt of $19,000 was made, then there is no question that

for the next three years another such debt will be made. If we keep such

a treasurer, the debt will never be paid. We must protect ourselves from

<a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>

debts; every day we are sinking into an abyss.</p>
      <p>

The priest must be a priest, his duty is to watch the altar and perform 
religious service, but not to do business with the hard-earned money

of the people, or to hide the money somewhere.</p>
      <p>
All the societies must agree among themselves to call a general meeting,
and at such a meeting elect a committee, and then this committee should

go to the bishop and present to him the condition of the treasury of our

parish. If the spiritual government would not sweep out such a cashier,

then we will go to the civil government, because the civil government's duty
is to protect the public from exploiters. Not the priest alone is guilty

for wasting the parish money, but the priest's committee

is guilty too, for soaping the public's eyes, and for covering the priest's

faulty conduct.</p>
